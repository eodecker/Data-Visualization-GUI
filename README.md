# Data-Visualization-GUI
A GUI tool for visualizing data with multiple dimensions made for my Data Visualization class (CS251).

To use the tool, run display.py using Python3 and then use Command-O to open a CSV file to visualize. Plot the data or perform an analyis on the data (PCA, cluster, linear regression) and then plot the data. For some types of data sets, you can animate the dataset (useful for seeing changes over time) by using the Run Simulation button.

Lots of example data sets included in the repository.
